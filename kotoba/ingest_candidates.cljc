;; tsukuru 作る — ingest candidates.edn into a live kotoba node, in a SEPARATE graph
;; from the consented/onboarded member registry (seed.edn → com.etzhayyim.tsukuru).
;; ADR-2605202800.
;;
;; candidates.edn is a public-directory RESEARCH dataset: every :factory/did uses the
;; "candidate:manufacturer-directory/..." form (never "did:web:tsukuru.etzhayyim.com/..."),
;; :factory/sourcing is :public-directory, and :factory/labor-provenance is :unknown for
;; every entry (see candidates.edn's own header). None of these companies have consented
;; to or been onboarded into the tsukuru registry. Projecting them into the SAME graph as
;; consented did:web members would blur that distinction for any downstream query — so
;; this script writes to its own graph (default "com.etzhayyim.tsukuru.candidates"),
;; never "com.etzhayyim.tsukuru", and refuses to run against that graph name (see
;; assert-not-member-graph below). Dry-run by default, live path placeholder — same
;; posture as ingest_mcp.cljc (no-server-key, G15; operator-bound).
